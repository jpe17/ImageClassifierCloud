# How to make predictions using a Multi-class Image Classifier?
## Use a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image classifier to make predictions.

### Steps to use this library to predict the class of an image.

1. Train the model on your dataset, using ```trainer.py``` in *../training-model* 

2. Install the *tensorflow* and *numpy* library using pip.
```
pip install tensorflow
pip install numpy
```
3. Execute the script ```predict.py```.
```
python predict.py
```

5. Upload a picture that you want to predict.
